1. China’s Export Model and Global Tensions
China’s industrial strategy prioritizes manufacturing dominance and trade surpluses, using state support to build world-leading capacity. While this has boosted global welfare via cheap goods, it has also disrupted manufacturing in other countries and strained global economic balance.

The U.S. views this model as unfair and unsustainable, arguing it undermines domestic industry and global norms. The EU shares concerns about overcapacity but prefers “de-risking” over decoupling. Developing nations appreciate cheap imports and Chinese investment but worry about being outcompeted in key sectors.

2. Systemic Rivalry and Legitimacy of China’s Model
China’s success as a non-democratic power undermines the Western post-war assumption that prosperity requires liberal democracy. Its political model is deeply at odds with the Western narrative of convergence.

U.S. policy treats China’s political system as illegitimate and incompatible with a stable global order. The EU raises human rights concerns but avoids ideological confrontation. The Global South generally accepts China’s system, prioritizing sovereignty and partnership over governance alignment.

3. Cold War Analogies and Integration vs. Containment
Kroeber argues that the U.S.–China rivalry differs fundamentally from the Cold War due to deep economic interdependence. China cannot and will not collapse like the Soviet Union; containment is impractical.

The U.S. increasingly adopts Cold War-style language and policies, advocating selective decoupling. The EU rejects this framing, preferring engagement with safeguards. The Global South opposes bloc politics and seeks to remain neutral and benefit from both sides.

4. Industrial Policy and the EV Case
China’s leap into EVs illustrates its strategy: identify future industries early, fund heavily, tolerate losses, and use foreign firms like Tesla as catalysts. This mix of direction, competition, and long-term investment has made Chinese EV firms globally competitive.

The U.S. sees this as proof of unfair subsidies and calls for industrial policy at home to respond. The EU debates defensive measures like tariffs but is divided on protectionism. Emerging economies admire the approach but often lack the means to replicate it fully.

5. China as a Venture-State
China operates like a large-scale VC fund: betting broadly across strategic sectors and scaling winners. Success depends not on central planning precision but on high tolerance for failure and intense competition.

Western models are more targeted and market-driven, with U.S. industrial policy limited to national security concerns. The EU is moving cautiously toward more state involvement. In the Global South, China’s model is admired, but capacity, funding, and governance limits make imitation challenging.

6. Debt, Risk, and Financial Stability
China has high macro leverage but avoids systemic crises by separating finance from industry and controlling most debt internally. Local government and property sector debt are major problems, but not likely to trigger collapse.

Western analysts fear misreporting and call for greater transparency. The U.S. and EU also press China to act responsibly in restructuring debts owed by Global South nations. Developing countries largely trust China to manage its debt but hope for more flexibility in bilateral relief.

7. Efficiency vs. Effectiveness in Growth
Kroeber argues that China prioritized growth and poverty reduction over efficiency, accepting redundancy and waste to drive rapid catch-up. This approach allowed for widespread development across a vast population.

Western economists warn that inefficiency will now constrain productivity and growth. The EU values China’s inclusive development but remains wary of market distortions. Many in the Global South see China’s approach as pragmatic and effective, especially compared to Western conditionality-heavy aid.

8. Xi Jinping’s Policy Shift and Its Effects
Xi shifted China’s focus from growth-at-all-costs to national tech self-sufficiency and social control, reining in the private sector. This has slowed growth and weakened domestic demand, despite notable progress in strategic sectors.

The U.S. interprets this as authoritarian overreach, damaging innovation and investor confidence. The EU sees regulatory unpredictability and tightened access. The Global South admires Xi’s control and anti-corruption stance but fears overcentralization could stifle dynamism.

9. Infrastructure as Enabler – Electricity and Information
China’s success owes much to early investment in digital networks and massive scaling of cheap, clean electricity. These foundational capabilities support dominance in industries from EVs to AI.

The U.S. and EU recognize the strategic advantage but differ in response: the U.S. prioritizes energy resilience; Europe lags on grid and industrial scaling. For developing countries, China’s infrastructure-first model is inspirational but hard to match without external support.

10. Tech Race and AI Prospects
China is scaling rapidly in AI and semiconductors, leveraging talent, state funding, and computing power. The government sees AI as a controllable general-purpose technology and is mobilizing across the stack.

The U.S. aims to block Chinese access to frontier chips and platforms, citing national security. The EU emphasizes ethical AI and regulatory leadership while trying to remain technologically sovereign. The Global South welcomes both U.S. and Chinese tech but wants affordability, local adaptation, and data sovereignty.
