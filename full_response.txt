China’s Manufacturing Dominance – Core Insights and Global Perspectives

Core Ideas and Arguments from Arthur Kroeber (Stage 1)
	1.	China’s Rise and Global Unease: Kroeber notes that many critics (especially in the West) worry that China seeks to “produce all the manufactured goods in the world” and run huge trade surpluses, essentially getting rich at others’ expense ￼. The fundamental concern is how China grows rich – whether it plays by global market rules or uses state-driven strategies that crowd out other countries’ industries. Moreover, China’s success as an authoritarian system challenges the post-WWII narrative that prosperity and stability come from democratic, market-oriented systems ￼. U.S. elites, in particular, have never accepted China’s one-party system as legitimate, creating deep mistrust ￼. Even though China’s export boom provided cheap goods and raised global welfare in a narrow economic sense, it also hollowed out manufacturing jobs in countries like the U.S., eroding social cohesion ￼. This makes China’s growing wealth politically and socially contentious abroad, not just an economic issue.
	2.	“Cold War” Misconceptions and Deep Integration: Kroeber argues that framing today’s U.S.–China rivalry as a new Cold War is inaccurate ￼. Unlike the Soviet Union, which was isolated from the West, China is deeply woven into the global economy with massive trade and investment links ￼. At its peak, China accounted for ~17% of U.S. trade – an integration “no precedent at any point in economic history” ￼. Unwinding these ties would be extraordinarily difficult ￼. Furthermore, China is “too big, too successful” to simply collapse or disappear as the USSR did ￼. Its development model, while having “a lot of problems,” has delivered sustained growth and benefits to many countries trading with China ￼. Even imagining a change in regime, any government ruling 1.4 billion Chinese would still insist on national strength, technology advancement, and independent power projection – the drivers of friction with the West would remain ￼ ￼. Thus, this strategic competition cannot end with one side’s sudden implosion or total victory; it must be managed with the reality of deep economic interdependence in mind.
	3.	Managing China’s Rise – Integration vs. Confrontation: Given China now makes up 20% of the world economy and over a third of global manufacturing ￼, Kroeber emphasizes the need for international rules so that other nations feel they benefit “not just in financial terms” ￼. Currently, there is no such agreement, fueling tensions. He suggests a counter-intuitive approach: more integration rather than less. For example, the U.S. could seek a “grand bargain” by embracing Chinese investment in American manufacturing – especially in electric vehicles, batteries, green tech, etc. – to revitalize its own industrial base ￼ ￼. This would mirror how China itself rose (learning from foreign investors) and signal that we are not in a Cold War (since high cross-investment is the opposite of a total shutout) ￼. Chinese firms, hungry for access to the U.S. market, would “love” such opportunities ￼. However, Kroeber acknowledges why this hasn’t happened: Washington has a bipartisan consensus blocking Chinese tech investment, largely over national-security concerns ￼. In an era when any advanced factory “is also a data creation machine,” American officials fear that industrial know-how and data could feed China’s military advantages ￼. Additionally, technology is now so dual-use that virtually any high-tech cooperation could have military implications ￼. Kroeber deems these legitimate worries ￼, which would necessitate careful regulation if Chinese investments were allowed. Overall, he contends a cooperative integration strategy could be “win-win,” but current political winds in the U.S. make it very difficult ￼. Likewise, he dismisses the notion of telling China to stay in a low-tech lane – Beijing “wants it all” and will never accept artificial limits on its development ambitions ￼, just as the U.S. itself would never tolerate another country dictating what industries it can pursue ￼.
	4.	State Directives and Leapfrogging – The EV Case: One of Kroeber’s central examples of China’s industrial strategy is its electric vehicle (EV) revolution, which he calls a “pretty good bet” by the Chinese government ￼. In the 1990s–2000s, China tried and failed to build globally competitive traditional automakers despite forcing foreign carmakers into joint ventures ￼ ￼. By around 2010, China still hadn’t birthed a “Toyota of China” – foreign JVs dominated profits and technology ￼ ￼. So Beijing opted to leapfrog. Around the late 2000s, it identified new energy vehicles and renewable power as the future, where Western firms had no huge head start ￼ ￼. The state poured enormous subsidies (estimated $200–300 billion) over a decade to build an EV supply chain – from batteries to motors – nurturing firms like BYD ￼ ￼. For years, returns were minimal and consumer uptake was low; by 2018, Chinese EVs were still unappealing to domestic buyers ￼. At that point, China made a pivotal move: it let Tesla build a wholly-owned factory in Shanghai – the first foreign auto plant in China without a joint venture ￼. Tesla’s popular models created a “catalytic” effect: they set a new benchmark for design and branding that Chinese EV makers scrambled to meet ￼ ￼. BYD and others rapidly improved their styling and quality (even hiring European designers) and, within a few years, matched Tesla in the China market on both price and performance ￼ ￼. By 2022, China’s EV companies were fiercely competitive globally. Kroeber draws two lessons: (a) the Chinese state can play a long game, relentlessly funding a targeted industry even through failures, until the sector matures ￼ ￼; (b) competition – both from foreign firms and domestic rivals – was crucial to ferret out what worked. Without Tesla’s example and the brutal pressure of an open market, China’s EV makers might never have reached world-class status ￼ ￼. In essence, the EV story illustrates how China mixes top-down direction (“we want an EV industry at any cost”) with bottom-up experimentation in the market to eventually great effect.
	5.	“Giant VC” – Strategic Investment at Scale: More broadly, Kroeber likens China’s industrial policy to a giant venture capital fund ￼. Beijing is willing to “lose huge amounts of money for a really long time” on broad portfolios of bets – assuming a few big winners will compensate for the many losers ￼. The government identifies an array of “strategic emerging industries” (a list since 2010 including semiconductors, advanced materials, biotech, etc.) and promotes them all, without needing perfect foresight on which will triumph ￼ ￼. This is not classic Soviet central planning; it’s more adaptive and venture-like. Crucially, China’s model piggybacks on two key East Asian development principles: export discipline and domestic competition. First, by focusing on export success, China ensured its firms face relentless global benchmarks, not just cozy protected home markets ￼ ￼. (Kroeber points out that if you only produce for a closed domestic market – as in old import-substitution strategies – companies can thrive through protection and political connections rather than upgrading technology ￼ ￼. China avoided that trap by making export performance a yardstick for success.) Second, China has maintained a cutthroat internal market with many players, including the presence of foreign companies on its soil to spur knowledge transfer and competition ￼. Unlike Japan, which kept outsiders at bay in its home market, China often invites leading foreign firms in (subject to local partnership or other conditions) to catalyze learning and to keep domestic firms on their toes ￼ ￼. In Kroeber’s view, this ecosystem – high competition, openness to ideas, and huge financial backing – allowed China to succeed in industries where others failed. He cites solar power as an example: starting around 2005, China decided to dominate solar photovoltaics and systematically built capacity at every step of the supply chain ￼ ￼. Firms endured years of oversupply and losses, cycles that would have bankrupted Western startups. Meanwhile, the U.S. saw one high-profile solar company (Solyndra) fail and concluded “industrial policy does not work” ￼. China had the opposite answer: accept some failures as the price of eventual success ￼. By the late 2010s, China had become the world leader in solar panels, batteries, 5G equipment, and other sectors deemed critical. The key, Kroeber stresses, is that the entire system – from government funding to competitive pressure – converged to support technological upgrading ￼. It wasn’t omniscient state planners picking one winner from day one; it was more about creating conditions for many attempts and doubling down on those that showed promise.
	6.	Financial Pragmatism – Avoiding Japan’s Pitfalls: In discussing China’s economic risks, Kroeber contrasts China with 1980s Japan to argue that China has learned from others’ mistakes. Japan’s spectacular rise ended in a 1990s crash partly because of an overextended financial-industrial complex – banks and companies intertwined in a debt-fueled bubble ￼ ￼. China watched that implosion (and similar problems in Korea) and made a deliberate choice to quarantine finance from industry: Chinese banks do not own big stakes in industrial firms, and vice versa, by law ￼. This separation means even though China today has very high debt in certain sectors, it is less likely to face an economy-wide meltdown of the kind Japan did ￼ ￼. Kroeber acknowledges that China is grappling with serious debt problems – over-leveraged property developers, and local governments that borrowed heavily for infrastructure ￼ ￼. Whole cities overbuilt and many projects now yield meager returns, creating a drag on growth. But these debts are siloed: state banks, backed by Beijing, can absorb losses and be recapitalized as needed, while most private firms and manufacturers in China are not highly leveraged ￼. In fact, because private companies long had trouble getting bank loans (state banks favored state-owned enterprises), they learned to finance growth mostly via retained earnings, keeping debt ratios low ￼. The upshot: China’s corporate sector is not teetering on a debt bubble in the way Japan’s was, even though other parts of the economy (real estate, local financing vehicles) clearly over-borrowed. China also intentionally drove a massive credit boom after 2008 to stave off recession, which led to excess infrastructure building ￼ ￼. Kroeber explains that the initial model of local governments borrowing against future land gains to build infrastructure was rational and worked well for years ￼ ￼. The problem was the post-2008 stimulus, when easy money flooded local projects with far less oversight, creating a “Frankenstein’s monster” of wasteful construction and debt ￼ ￼. Now China must clean up those excesses. Total debt in the economy is roughly 300% of GDP, extremely high for a middle-income country ￼ ￼. Kroeber is concerned – heavy debt will act as a persistent tax on growth ￼. But he is not apocalyptic: virtually all Chinese debt is in domestic currency and owed internally, so a classic emerging-market foreign debt crisis is unlikely ￼ ￼. Instead, the danger is a Japan-style stagnation with deflationary pressures. To escape that fate, Kroeber argues, China needs to stimulate domestic demand (household spending, services) and tolerate a bit of inflation to erode debt – essentially the strategy that quietly resolved China’s last bad debt cycle in the late 1990s ￼ ￼. In the 90s, China grew out of a banking crisis by unleashing growth (and inflation) that outpaced the debt. A “revamped version” of that, he says, is required now: policies that put more money in consumers’ pockets and generate moderate price rises, so that revenues and incomes can catch up to debt burdens over time ￼ ￼. This is as much a political shift as an economic one, since it means pivoting from the old playbook of state-led investment to a new focus on household welfare.
	7.	“Efficiency” vs. Effectiveness – Growth at Scale: Responding to those who question why China isn’t richer per capita despite its industrial prowess, Kroeber cautions against an “efficiency fallacy” ￼. He observes that Western economists trained to value optimal resource use often criticize China’s system as inefficient – too many subsidies, misallocated capital, zombie state firms, etc. But China’s goal was never micro-efficiency; it was maximizing growth and development across a vast population ￼. By mobilizing “huge swaths of resources” – high savings, state banks, construction campaigns – China achieved historically unprecedented growth (roughly 10% annually for 20+ years) ￼ ￼. Yes, there was waste and redundancy, but that may have been the price of speed and breadth ￼ ￼. Kroeber argues China’s method was effective in transforming a poor agrarian society, even if not efficient in Western accounting terms ￼. For instance, pushing infrastructure and factories into less-developed interior provinces might be inefficient economically, but it spread development and maintained social stability – vital goals in a country of 1.4 billion. The sheer scale of China means it cannot replicate the tidy, rapid per-capita gains of smaller Asian “tiger” economies. Taiwan and South Korea moved from poverty to ~70% of U.S. income levels in two generations, but they had populations of only 20–50 million ￼. China has been urbanizing 20+ million people a year – effectively building entire new megacities annually – yet still has hundreds of millions in lower-productivity rural situations ￼. Even doing everything right, elevating a population of this size to high-income status is a multi-decade endeavor ￼ ￼. Kroeber points out that China’s breakneck growth already lifted 800 million people out of poverty; its per-capita GDP is about one-fifth of America’s now, which, given the starting point, is a remarkable feat. Thus, he slightly rebuts the notion that China “should have grown even faster” if only it were more efficient – that expectation, he implies, is unrealistic when China was already “growing faster than anyone has grown before” ￼ ￼. In summary, scale and initial conditions matter: China’s developmental sprint was extraordinary, but getting from middle-income to rich will naturally be harder and slower, especially as easy wins (cheap labor, basic infrastructure catch-up) are exhausted.
	8.	Xi’s Pivot: Tech-Driven Strategy and Its Costs: According to Kroeber, around 2012–2015 China’s leadership under Xi Jinping fundamentally shifted priorities. For decades prior, China’s approach was growth at all costs – local officials were rewarded on GDP targets, whether the growth came from factories, housing, or shopping malls ￼ ￼. This produced huge growth but also corruption, inequality, and waste. Xi decided to “hunker down” and focus on what he deems the “central task”: upgrading technology and reducing reliance on foreign (especially U.S.) tech ￼ ￼. Xi’s government grew less tolerant of unbridled expansion in other areas. It launched the “Made in China 2025” agenda to become self-sufficient or dominant in semiconductors, aerospace, AI, and other high-tech fields. At the same time, Xi pursued “common prosperity,” seeking to rein in excesses of private capital that were seen as undermining social fairness or creating financial risk. This led to a sweeping regulatory crackdown around 2020–2021: the sudden halt of Ant Group’s fintech IPO, strict limits on online lending and fintech, new rules for internet platforms, restrictions on data export, a purge of for-profit tutoring, and tighter control over entertainment and social media content ￼ ￼. Sectors that had boomed in the 2000s under laissez-faire conditions – e-commerce, digital finance, ride-hailing – were now tightly regulated or in some cases dismantled. Kroeber explains that for about 20 years, China’s tech platforms operated in a “Wild West” with almost no regulation (aside from censorship) ￼. Suddenly, Beijing told companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Didi there are many things “you may not do” if they conflict with financial stability, social order, or Communist Party control ￼. Similarly, an emerging private shadow banking sector that provided credit to entrepreneurs was rolled back, forcing lending back into big state banks ￼ ￼. The motivation, in Kroeber’s view, was partly ideological (the Party reasserting control) and partly an overconfidence that hard tech (chips, machinery, EVs) matters more for China’s future than consumer-oriented services. Xi’s team, he says, has a certain “technological fetishism” – a belief that leadership in physical technologies automatically translates to broad economic prosperity ￼ ￼. They seem willing to sacrifice some short-term growth and the vibrancy of the private service sector in order to channel resources into strategic tech sectors. The downside of this approach, Kroeber argues, is a shortfall in aggregate demand. By curbing fast-growing internet and financial services and not yet having a consumer spending boom to replace them, China’s economy has slowed markedly ￼. Domestic consumer confidence was also hit by these crackdowns and by harsh COVID measures (the zero-COVID policy, which Kroeber elsewhere notes was a clear policy blunder that dented growth). China’s GDP growth, which used to easily hit 6–7%, has downshifted to perhaps half that rate. Kroeber believes current growth is “well below potential” ￼. Signs of deflation emerged in 2023–2024, with falling producer prices and weak household spending. Essentially, China’s heavy investment in supply (factories, R&D, infrastructure) isn’t being matched by demand, in part because the very sectors that could stimulate consumer spending (property, fintech, online services) have been restrained. By 2023, Chinese policymakers began openly acknowledging the need to boost domestic demand and consumer confidence – a notable rhetorical shift after years of emphasis on supply-side reform ￼ ￼. Kroeber sums it up by saying China spent 45 years perfecting an investment-and-industry machine, but “no time… figuring out how to create a demand machine” ￼. Now they must quickly learn, in order to avoid a deflationary spiral where weak demand begets falling prices and incomes, which in turn begets even weaker demand ￼ ￼. This internal rebalancing is perhaps the biggest economic test for China’s leadership going forward.
	9.	Enabling Infrastructure – Information and Electricity: Kroeber highlights that Beijing’s real talent has been in building the foundational infrastructure that empowers industries. He gives two striking examples. First, the telecom and internet infrastructure: far from fearing the internet, the Chinese state embraced it early – but on its own terms ￼. In the 1990s, contrary to Western predictions that the internet would undermine authoritarian control, China invested massively in networking the country while erecting filters (the Great Firewall) to keep control of content. The result was two-fold: China now has a thriving digital economy with its own tech giants (Alibaba, Tencent, etc.), and the government achieved a level of social surveillance and opinion monitoring once unimaginable ￼ ￼. By having “people watching the internet,” authorities can gauge public sentiment and quash dissent in real time ￼. This marriage of high-tech connectivity and censorship turned the internet from a threat into a tool for the regime. It also insulated local tech firms from U.S. competition (Google, Facebook, Twitter are blocked), allowing homegrown innovations to flourish behind the firewall. Second, electrification: China understood that industrial supremacy and new technologies would hinge on ample, cheap electricity ￼ ￼. In the early 2000s, rolling power blackouts were hampering factories ￼. Beijing responded by building power generation at an astounding pace (mostly coal at first). Then, anticipating the electric car boom and the need for high-speed rail, China built outsize capacity in power and a nationwide ultra-high-voltage grid. The logic was: if millions of cars and an entire transportation network run on electricity, we must not have energy bottlenecks ￼ ￼. In parallel, for energy security and pollution reasons, China pushed renewables and nuclear aggressively. It now has more renewable power capacity than the entire U.S. power grid ￼. China’s total electrical output is roughly double America’s ￼, and electricity’s share of Chinese energy consumption has risen to ~30% (versus ~15% in most countries) and climbing ￼ ￼. This abundance of affordable electricity is a strategic edge. For example, running energy-hungry data centers for AI and cloud computing is easier when power is cheap and plentiful. Kroeber suggests China wants to keep its electricity prices so low that no other nation can easily compete in power-intensive industries ￼ – from smelting aluminum to fabricating chips or training AI models. By being the first to scale up key general-purpose technologies (the internet, electric power, 5G, etc.), China set the stage for dominance in industries built atop those platforms. Kroeber’s broader point is that picking specific winners (say one company or one product) is less important than building the ecosystem and underlying capacity. If you get the infrastructure and human capital right, competitive enterprises will eventually emerge. This focus on long-term enablers helps explain China’s sustained manufacturing dominance. It’s not just cheap labor – it’s the massive, modern ports; the high-speed rails and highways linking factories; the universities churning out engineers; the reliable electric grid; and the dense supplier networks. These create a self-reinforcing advantage that other developing nations struggle to replicate.
	10.	The Technology Race and Global Implications: Finally, Kroeber touches on the intensifying race in cutting-edge technologies, especially AI and semiconductors, which is a nexus of economic and geopolitical competition. China, with its huge talent pool and data scale, has made impressive gains – he cites that Chinese AI researchers and firms are at or near the frontier in some areas (e.g. DeepSea, a notable large-language model, emerged from a private Chinese venture rather than a state lab) ￼. But Kroeber is “unclear” on where the broad economic gains from AI will actually flow ￼. His hunch leans on an innovation theory: real value comes from applications (using technology to solve diverse consumer/business problems) rather than just owning the core technology. And here he gives the edge to open, market-driven systems like the U.S. The U.S. and its allies have the entire world as a playground for AI applications, whereas China’s tech ecosystem is relatively self-contained (the “walled garden”) ￼. Western AI firms can deploy services across North America, Europe, India, etc., whereas Chinese firms mostly serve China and parts of the developing world. This matters because a wider user base and more competition in applications can lead to more innovation and economic payoff. Moreover, China’s recent inward turn makes it harder for foreign experts or companies to collaborate on its soil (and vice versa), possibly limiting its access to the best ideas if global AI innovation remains borderless for democracies ￼ ￼. On the other hand, China’s strengths are scale and determination. Kroeber points out that if AI’s progress comes down to scaling up – more data, more computing power – China is extremely well-positioned. It adds power generation capacity equivalent to a midsize country every year, meaning it can support energy-hungry AI computing on a massive scale ￼ ￼. Its centralized governance can marshal resources behind national priorities (for instance, pouring billions into chip fabrication technologies to replace U.S. suppliers). He expects the Chinese state to treat AI much like it treated the internet: something to be harnessed, not feared. Despite some officials’ nervousness that advanced AI (like ChatGPT-style models) could spread uncontrolled information, the prevailing view in Beijing likely is “we will figure out how to control it” while still pushing the technology forward ￼ ￼. Indeed, when a maverick Chinese entrepreneur released a powerful AI model unexpectedly, authorities were initially alarmed it hadn’t come from the state’s plan ￼. But there is recognition that clamping down too hard would only make China lose the AI race. Kroeber notes that, ironically, the Chinese tech landscape is not monolithic – companies like Huawei, Baidu, Alibaba each pursue their own AI efforts, and Beijing can’t simply force them into one unified program ￼. This fragmentation, combined with current U.S. export controls on top-end semiconductor chips, is a hurdle for China. If compute resources are split among many actors, none may reach the absolute cutting edge before the others. The global policy response to China’s tech rise has been sharpened: the U.S. now bans export of the most advanced chips and chipmaking tools to China, trying to slow its progress. U.S. officials argue that China’s use of advanced tech for surveillance and military modernization is a threat. Europe, for its part, is more ambivalent – it seeks to “de-risk” by reducing critical dependencies (for example, Europe doesn’t want to rely on Chinese 5G networks or EV batteries too heavily) but still engages with China economically. Meanwhile, many countries in the Global South are eager adopters of Chinese tech (from Huawei telecom gear to AI surveillance systems) because of cost and the fact that China imposes fewer political conditions. All these trends underscore that China’s manufacturing and tech dominance is not purely an economic matter but a strategic one that other powers respond to. Kroeber’s overarching takeaway is that China will remain a formidable industrial and technological force – its system has proven adept at mobilizing resources and learning over time. The open question is whether China can rebalance and innovate fast enough under tighter internal control and external pressure, and whether the world can devise new rules to accommodate China’s rise without excessive conflict.

Global Context: US, EU, and Global South Perspectives (Stage 2)

For each of Kroeber’s core ideas above, there are differing viewpoints and strategic responses among Western powers and the Global South. Below we contextualize and contrast key perspectives:
	1.	China’s export model and global fairness: United States: U.S. policymakers increasingly label China’s trade practices mercantilist, arguing that Beijing suppresses domestic consumption and heavily subsidizes exports to gain market share ￼. The huge U.S. trade deficit with China (peaking around $300+ billion annually) is seen by many in Washington as evidence of unfair play – from currency manipulation in the past to state-backed overcapacity now. This has fueled tariffs (the Trump-era trade war) and export controls on technology. U.S. labor groups and politicians also highlight the harm to domestic manufacturing employment, framing China’s “getting rich” as coming “on the backs” of American workers. European Union: EU leaders share concerns about trade imbalances and subsidized Chinese competition but take a less confrontational tone. The EU has called China a “systemic rival” in some areas, yet also a partner in others. Europe is alarmed, for instance, by China’s dominance in solar panels and electric vehicles – industries where Chinese imports undercut European producers. In 2023, the EU launched an anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EV imports, signalling potential tariffs. However, the European stance emphasizes “de-risking” rather than decoupling: as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen put it, completely severing economic ties is “neither viable – nor in Europe’s interest,” so instead Europe seeks to reduce dependency on critical Chinese inputs while still “engag(ing) constructively” with Beijing ￼. Europe also urges China to play by WTO rules and often works with the U.S. at the WTO to challenge practices like forced tech transfer. Global South: Developing countries have a more ambivalent view. On one hand, they benefited from China’s rise through affordable goods and Chinese investment. On the other, many emerging economies face fierce competitive pressure from China’s overcapacity. Studies note that Chinese “surplus production and market dominance” in industries like steel, textiles, and solar have “disrupted local industries” in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia, making it harder for those countries to industrialize ￼. For example, African textile and shoe manufacturers struggle against cheap Chinese imports. Countries like Mexico or Vietnam gained some manufacturing as wages rose in China, but others (especially where industrial bases are nascent) feel squeezed. There’s also concern about becoming too dependent on Chinese imports ￼. That said, many in the Global South do not blame China outright – they often criticize Western trade rules as well and see China as a counterbalance offering choices (e.g. China granting zero-tariff access to least-developed countries, providing infrastructure loans, etc.). In forums like the G77 or African Union, leaders call for reforms to global trade that give developing nations more room – implicitly acknowledging that China’s meteoric export growth is a challenge, but also that rich-world protectionism and lack of technology sharing are issues. In summary, where Western officials talk of unfairness and reciprocity, Global South voices talk of inclusive growth and may seek a middle path, leveraging China’s investment but guarding their nascent industries.
	2.	Ideological narratives and political models: United States: U.S. strategy increasingly frames the competition with China as part of a broader contest between democracy and authoritarianism. American policymakers (especially since 2017) are openly skeptical that a “successful authoritarian” China can coexist in the world order without undermining liberal values and U.S. interests. This view harkens back to Cold War moral framing – hence terms like “free world vs. techno-authoritarian bloc” emerge in U.S. discourse. However, unlike the Soviet containment which was largely military/economic, with China the ideological charge is complicated by deep trade ties. Nonetheless, bipartisan consensus in the U.S. sees China’s political system – with its human rights issues (Xinjiang, Hong Kong), state surveillance, and party control of business – as a core reason to limit China’s influence. Some U.S. officials explicitly question the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party’s rule (echoing what Kroeber noted) and hope that economic pressure might, over time, force political change in China (though Kroeber argues this is unlikely). European Union: European governments are divided but generally less confrontational on ideology. The EU does criticize China on human rights and has sanctioned Chinese officials over Xinjiang abuses, for example. Von der Leyen and others have described China as a “systemic rival promoting an alternative governance model.” Yet major EU states avoid framing the relationship as ideological trench warfare – they emphasize multilateralism and point out that China’s cooperation is needed on global issues (climate change, health, etc.). European rhetoric thus balances values with pragmatism. Notably, some European leaders (France’s President Macron, for instance) have warned against Europe being drawn into a U.S.-led ideological crusade, advocating “strategic autonomy.” Europe also remembers the costs of Cold War divisions on the continent and so prefers engagement and dialogue (e.g. the EU-China Human Rights Dialogue, though stalled, exemplifies trying to address differences through talks). Global South: Most developing nations reject a binary democracy-versus-autocracy framing. Many are themselves not liberal democracies, and even those that are (India being a prominent democracy in the Global South) often pursue a non-aligned stance to maximize their own interests. China skillfully presents itself as a champion of the developing world, emphasizing principles of sovereignty and non-interference – appealing to countries long lectured by the West on governance. Beijing’s narrative is that it offers respect and partnership “without political strings,” in contrast to Western aid or IMF loans tied to governance reforms. This message resonates in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. For example, China’s Foreign Minister has said the core global divide is development vs. containment – implying wealthy powers try to keep down rising nations like China and its partners ￼. That rhetoric finds sympathy among leaders who feel disadvantaged by the Western-led order. However, it’s not universally accepted: some in the Global South are wary of Chinese authoritarian influence (for instance, internet censorship tools or high-tech surveillance exported by China could enable local autocrats). Democratic countries like India position themselves as an alternative model – showcasing that democracy can also deliver growth – and sometimes subtly align with Western values rhetoric when it serves (India often highlights being the “world’s largest democracy” in contrast to China). Broadly, though, the Global South does not want a new Cold War forcing a choice. They prefer to extract benefits from both sides: Chinese investment and U.S./European markets. Ideologically, they lean toward pluralism – accommodating different systems rather than crusading against one.
	3.	Cold War analogies and decoupling: United States: Despite Kroeber’s caution, a cohort of U.S. strategists (sometimes dubbed the “China hawks”) indeed advocate a partial decoupling. They argue that the U.S. became too economically entangled with a strategic adversary, and that critical supply chains (for example, medical supplies, rare earths, semiconductors) must be brought home or at least out of China. The Trump administration openly pursued decoupling via tariffs and bans; the Biden administration, while using a milder tone, has continued restricting tech flows and is investing in domestic manufacturing (e.g. the CHIPS Act) to reduce reliance on China. However, even U.S. officials acknowledge a total decoupling is unrealistic – Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has spoken of a “constructive but secure” relationship and says decoupling would be “disastrous.” Instead, the U.S. approach is evolving into what one might call “small yard, high fence”: restrict trade and investment only in sensitive areas (the “small yard”) like advanced tech, while keeping fences high around those areas, but allow more normal trade in non-sensitive goods ￼ ￼. The Brookings Institution, for example, recommends a risk-based trade regime that safeguards national security without severing all commerce ￼. Still, the political rhetoric in Washington often outpaces these nuances, and talk of a new Cold War – democracy vs. China – is common in Congress. European Union: The EU explicitly distances itself from “decoupling.” European leaders criticize broad-brush decoupling as harmful to global prosperity and stability. Instead, as noted, they pursue “de-risking.” In practice, de-risking means diversifying suppliers (e.g. encouraging European companies to invest in India, Vietnam, Mexico as alternatives for some imports), screening Chinese investments in Europe for security risks (the EU now has a mechanism for this), and safeguarding strategic sectors (like not letting a Chinese firm buy a port terminal that could affect critical infrastructure). But Europe continues to engage economically with China. Germany, for instance, has enormous trade with China and its latest strategy calls China simultaneously a partner, competitor, and rival. The tone has hardened – Europe is more openly critical of things like China’s support of Russia or economic coercion against EU member Lithuania – yet Europe also frequently asserts that, unlike the U.S., it is not seeking to contain China. The SCMP article from early 2025 even suggests a softening: facing potential U.S. protectionism under a new administration, EU officials hinted at improving ties with China to hedge their bets ￼ ￼. This highlights that Europe’s stance can shift with geopolitical winds, but a core principle remains: Europe wants to avoid a bifurcated world and keep China integrated in multilateral frameworks, albeit on fairer terms. Global South: For developing nations, a new Cold War or forced decoupling is unwelcome. They have vivid memories of being battlegrounds for influence during the US–USSR Cold War and do not want to repeat that scenario. Many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have China as their top trading partner and also rely on Western investment and aid – a rupture would be devastating. At forums like the Non-Aligned Movement (revived in rhetoric if not formal structure), states advocate multilateralism and warn against “great power confrontation.” Even U.S. allies like the Philippines or Saudi Arabia maintain strong ties with China while on security matters leaning to the U.S., essentially practicing hedging. One exception is perhaps India, which due to its border conflicts and rivalry with China is decoupling somewhat (e.g. banning Chinese apps, limiting Huawei, seeking to replace Chinese imports under “Make in India”). But India is unique in size and capability. Smaller states largely can’t afford to decouple from China’s affordable goods or its financing of infrastructure (via the Belt and Road Initiative). Instead, the Global South voices emphasize inclusive globalization – they want a seat at the table to reshape rules, rather than a breakdown into blocs. Some even leverage great power competition to their advantage: e.g. Southeast Asian countries quietly enjoy U.S. and China competing to invest or offer favorable trade terms in their region. In summary, decoupling for the West means difficult economic adjustments; for the Global South it could mean collateral damage – so there’s broad resistance outside certain U.S. circles to an all-out economic divorce with China.
	4.	China’s industrial policy success (EVs, etc.) – admiration or anxiety: United States: In the U.S., China’s ability to build entire industries through subsidies and state direction is often viewed as a competitive threat that must be met with U.S. industrial policy. There’s a notable shift in Washington: where once “industrial policy” was a dirty word, now huge programs like the Inflation Reduction Act (with green tech subsidies) and CHIPS Act (semiconductor incentives) have bipartisan support, explicitly to compete with China. U.S. officials cite China’s EV subsidy program or dominance in solar panel manufacturing as justification to bolster American industries. At the same time, there’s resentment – a belief that China “cheated” by stealing intellectual property and forcing tech transfers from Western firms that invested in China. This was a core grievance in the Trump-era tariffs. The irony, as Kroeber noted, is that if one truly believes U.S. companies were exploited in China, the U.S. could reciprocally invite Chinese firms and extract know-how from them. But U.S. politics would not allow that easily. So the stance is defensive: tighten IP protections, sue China in WTO for subsidy violations (the U.S. and EU have filed cases on China’s support to sectors like aluminum and aerospace), and protect home industries. There’s also an element of envy or awe: some American analysts grudgingly respect how fast China built, say, a world-class high-speed rail network or cornered rare earth mining, and argue the U.S. should invest similarly in infrastructure and R&D. Others caution that copy-pasting China’s methods in a democracy is not feasible or desirable. European Union: The EU similarly has grown more appreciative of industrial policy in light of China. The European Commission unveiled initiatives for homegrown production of batteries, chips, and hydrogen technology, often referencing unfair Chinese competition. France has long advocated a more protective stance (the term “European champions” is analogous to China’s national champions). Germany, traditionally export-focused and free-trade, has also shifted after some shocks (shortages of medical supplies early in the pandemic, or China’s aggressive moves). European industry groups press the EU to level the playing field – for instance, European solar manufacturers collapsed under a wave of cheap Chinese panels around 2012, which led the EU to impose temporary tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Now, with China far ahead in EVs, Europe debates responses like tariffs or big subsidies for European EV supply chains. That said, Europe’s financial capacity for subsidies is lower and internal rules against state aid sometimes constrain action (those rules are easing in response to both China and the U.S. IRA). European public opinion is also wary of Chinese investments in critical sectors: take the example of COSCO (a Chinese state firm) wanting a stake in Hamburg Port – it sparked controversy and was allowed only in a limited form. So Europe is tightening oversight while trying not to shut the door to business. In short, Europe acknowledges China’s ruthless competition – EU reports explicitly call out overcapacity and market distortions – and is inching toward policies that were taboo before, like subsidy races and stricter trade defense. Global South: Reactions in the Global South vary by country. Some emerging economies admire China’s state-led model and seek to emulate aspects of it. Governments in countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda, or Vietnam have openly studied China’s approach to manufacturing and infrastructure (Vietnam’s Communist Party has its own strategies to become a manufacturing hub, which have had success in textiles and electronics). That said, no other developing nation has China’s combination of scale, centralized authority, and capital. Many Belt and Road partner countries are delighted to receive Chinese-built highways, power plants, and factories – it’s a shortcut to industrialization, they hope. But there are also cautionary tales: if Chinese companies dominate the projects, local skill transfer can be limited. Countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, for instance, insist on more local content in Chinese projects now than they did initially. In sectors like textiles or basic consumer goods, many poorer nations feel China crowded them out, as mentioned. Bangladesh’s garment industry survived by focusing on apparel (where China moved up the value chain). Mexico leveraged NAFTA to stay competitive in cars and electronics despite China. But places without such advantages often couldn’t compete head-on with China’s combination of cost and scale. This fuels a narrative in some African circles that the West had its Industrial Revolution, then Asia (led by China) had theirs, and Africa risks being left behind as a de-industrialized market. Thus, some African and South Asian leaders call for “smart protectionism” or more favorable trade terms to build their own industries even as they take in Chinese investment. In essence, China’s industrial rise is a double-edged sword for fellow developing countries: it provides a model and often capital/equipment to others, but it also presents a formidable competitor that can undercut nascent industries before they grow.
	5.	China as a “VC state” – policy flexibility vs. other models: United States & EU: Western economists have noted aspects of China’s experimental approach, but opinions differ on its sustainability. Some U.S. analysts (particularly those aligned with free-market thinking) argue that China’s scattershot investing leads to massive waste – empty “ghost cities,” redundant factories, environmental damage – which will eventually weigh China down. They often cite the need for China to undertake market reforms (e.g. let inefficient SOEs fail) to avoid the “middle-income trap.” Others, more keyed to Kroeber’s view, see China’s tolerance for failure as a strength, enabling it to seize new industries. In practice, recent U.S. and European industrial policies are more targeted (the U.S. isn’t investing in every emerging tech, but specifically semiconductors, batteries, etc., where it feels urgency). The Western democratic process also means strategies can change with elections – unlike China’s sustained push sustained over decades. This inconsistency is seen by some in the West as a disadvantage; by others as a check against sinking too much into losing bets. A case in point: the U.S. invested in Solyndra (solar company) which failed, and that indeed caused a political backlash against green subsidies for years ￼. China had numerous Solyndras but kept going – and now dominates solar manufacturing. European countries historically had industrial policies (France’s aerospace, Germany’s auto co-determination model, etc.), but nothing on China’s scale except perhaps in smaller economies like Singapore. Now, facing China, Western discourse has coined terms like “state-capitalist” or “party-state economy” to describe China, often pejoratively. Think tanks recommend that the West should not copy China’s model wholesale but should update rules to prevent China’s “non-market” practices from disadvantaging them – for example, tightening anti-dumping rules or screening subsidized Chinese companies out of public tenders. Global South: Many developing countries’ governments have fewer resources to act like venture capitalists. A nation like India has a more private-sector-led growth model and, while it has done industrial planning (e.g. electronic manufacturing incentives), it cannot marshal the kind of funds China did. Some oil-rich states like Saudi Arabia or UAE are now attempting a China-esque approach by investing oil revenues into futuristic industries – essentially acting as venture investors for a post-oil economy (e.g. Neom city, renewable energy projects). The results remain to be seen. Meanwhile, countries in Africa or Latin America often face IMF constraints or budget limitations that preclude massive subsidy programs. Those that tried heavy state-led development in the past (e.g. Brazil’s push into consumer electronics, or various African socialism experiments mid-20th century) often failed due to lack of global competitiveness. So, the Chinese model has revived interest in industrial policy globally, but also skepticism: many ask, “Can anyone else do what China did, or was it unique to China’s circumstances?” Even Chinese officials frame their model as rooted in “China’s national conditions.” Global South economists frequently call for a middle ground: some state guidance and protection for infant industries, but within limits and coupled with efforts to join global value chains (rather than China’s more autonomous approach). In summary, while Western and developing nations alike are influenced by China’s venture-state approach, they calibrate it to their contexts – with the West focusing on specific strategic dependencies and the Global South trying selective interventions where feasible.
	6.	Debt and financial risks – external views: United States & EU: Western analysts have warned of a looming “China debt crisis” for over a decade; so far China has avoided a hard crash, leading some to joke about “immaculate deflation” (protracted slowdown without crisis). The prevailing view in financial circles now is aligned with Kroeber: China’s debt will likely drag down growth, but an acute financial meltdown is unlikely barring a huge policy error. U.S. and European officials are nevertheless concerned because China’s economic health affects the world. The IMF and World Bank routinely urge China to rebalance from investment to consumption – advice the West has given for years. They worry that continued debt buildup could at some point cause a banking crisis or, more subtly, that China’s slowdown due to debt overhang could export deflationary pressure globally (cheap excess supply from China and weaker Chinese demand for imports). There is also a geopolitical angle: China’s Belt and Road loans have made several developing countries indebted to China, which Western officials call “debt-trap diplomacy” – though scholars debate that characterization. Beijing has started renegotiating loans with countries like Sri Lanka and Zambia; Western creditors coordinate through the Paris Club and now want China (a non-Paris-Club lender) to follow common restructuring rules. So far, China has been hesitant, preferring bilateral case-by-case workouts. This has caused friction, with the U.S. Treasury publicly urging China to offer deeper debt relief to distressed borrowers. In essence, Western policy circles view China’s domestic debt as a manageable internal issue for China, but China’s external lending as a potential global problem if mismanaged. Global South: Many developing countries look at China’s high debt and see lessons both positive and negative. Some admire how China turned debt into concrete assets (infrastructure, cities) and maintained control over creditors – a stark contrast to, say, Latin American countries in the 1980s debt crisis who had debts in dollars and faced harsh external conditionality. The fact that China owes money mostly to itself (through state banks) is envied by those who borrow from foreign bond markets in foreign currencies. However, there’s also a caution: China’s property bust, with half-built apartments and indebted local governments, is a scenario familiar to countries that over-invested in real estate (e.g. Spain before 2008, or Thailand 1997). If China with all its control can fall into such a trap, others worry about their own trajectories. Belt and Road partner nations are directly impacted by China’s financial health too – a slowdown in China means less demand for commodities (hurting African and Latin economies) and possibly less outward investment. For instance, if Chinese banks become more constrained, new infrastructure deals abroad might dwindle. Some in the Global South also quietly worry that if China’s economy really faltered, it might become more inward-looking and reduce its role as the engine of developing-world growth. But at a public level, developing country officials mostly express confidence that China will manage its challenges (partly out of diplomatic goodwill). They often appreciate that China, unlike Western lenders, was willing to invest in big projects and take risks in their countries. Now, those same countries are stuck with debt to China and hope China, as a partner, will show flexibility (like extending loan maturities). This is an ongoing test of China’s role as a lender – and it’s being watched as a barometer of China’s global leadership vs. self-interest.
	7.	Growth vs. efficiency – the development debate: United States & EU: In academic and economic circles in the West, there’s debate on whether China’s model is ultimately wasteful or a new paradigm. Free-market proponents argue that China must eventually face a reckoning for its inefficiencies: capital misallocation will lower productivity and trend growth (indeed China’s total factor productivity growth has slowed). They often cite how Japan’s high-growth era similarly had misallocations that led to stagnation. Others counter that China’s ability to mobilize resources is a feature that can’t be measured by conventional efficiency metrics – for example, even if some highways are underused now, they enable future growth. Western business elites who operate in China sometimes have firsthand frustration at inefficient bureaucracy or guanxi-driven decisions, but they also marvel at how fast things get done (an “inefficient” process that still builds a bridge in two years might beat an “efficient” process that never builds it). European policymakers, especially in infrastructure, have seen that while they debate and regulate, Chinese firms just build – so Europe launched its own “Global Gateway” infrastructure plan partly to offer a more efficient but less blunt alternative. In terms of inequality, Western observers note China’s rapid growth did bring high inequality and now China is trying to correct that (common prosperity), which somewhat mirrors Western welfare states – interestingly, some in the West criticize China for not having a stronger social safety net (too much emphasis on investment over social spending). This criticism aligns with urging more consumption: if Chinese households felt secure (pensions, healthcare), they’d save less and spend more, improving efficiency of demand. European social economists often emphasize this point. Global South: Many in the developing world take heart from China’s success in poverty reduction – viewing it as evidence that strong state-led growth can lift masses out of poverty even if Gini coefficients rise initially. The “inefficiency” argument is sometimes brushed aside in Global South discourse with the retort that Western efficiency didn’t produce such rapid development in poorer countries. Policymakers from countries like Vietnam or Bangladesh, which have grown well, often talk about benchmarking China’s growth strategies (with adaptations). However, there’s also a group of intellectuals in places like India who argue that democracy and decentralized innovation will outperform China’s state-directed approach in the long run – essentially saying “slow and steady” (with market efficiency and individual freedoms) is better than breakneck mobilization that could hit a wall. India’s slower growth compared to China is a point of contention: was it due to democracy (as Lee Kuan Yew once suggested) or due to less effective policies? The jury is out. What’s clear is China’s scale – as Kroeber highlighted – means it’s in its own category. No other country except India has to uplift over a billion people. So, when African leaders visit China, they often come away inspired by the visible infrastructure and reduction in poverty, less concerned about how many bad loans it took to get there. Their focus is on effectiveness – “did it work?” – and China, in their eyes, worked in many respects. Thus, the Western critique of inefficiency is sometimes seen in the Global South as missing the forest for the trees, or even as sour grapes.
	8.	Xi’s policy shifts – global interpretations: United States: U.S. officials and analysts mostly view Xi’s tightening and crackdowns as confirmation that China’s system is fundamentally in conflict with liberal economic principles. The sudden regulatory moves (like canceling Ant Group’s IPO in 2020) shocked global investors and contributed to a perception of China as becoming less predictable and less friendly to private enterprise. American business lobbies, which historically advocated engagement, have grown cooler as their companies face data localization laws, raids on due-diligence firms, and so forth. This has strengthened the U.S. government’s hand in pushing strategic decoupling, since the U.S. private sector is no longer uniformly pro-China trade. Some American commentators also frame Xi’s common prosperity and tech-sector leash as an authoritarian clampdown born of fear – fear that tech billionaires or a freewheeling internet could challenge the Party’s authority. The analogy to Jack Ma’s fate (the outspoken Alibaba founder sidelined) is frequently cited: “In China, the Party comes first.” Thus, the U.S. narrative often is: under Xi, China is sacrificing growth for control, which will ultimately weaken its economy and perhaps its long-term innovation potential. On the strategic front, U.S. security hawks welcome the idea of China prioritizing control over growth, believing it makes China less economically formidable over time. But in the near term, they see Xi’s consolidation (e.g. removing term limits, centralizing power) as making China a more assertive and less risk-averse adversary – for example, more aggressive on Taiwan or in the South China Sea to stoke nationalism if domestic growth flags. European Union: Europeans mirror some of these concerns. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China has been quite vocal about the regulatory uncertainty and the erosion of the reform era mantra “wealth is glorious.” European companies in consumer tech, finance, media, etc., feel especially squeezed by China’s new rules. Unlike the U.S., the EU doesn’t have a security architecture in Asia and is less worried about hard-power conflict, so it focuses on economic risks. EU officials lament that Xi’s China is less about “reform and opening” and more about state control – making it harder to justify deepening ties. For instance, the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (negotiated in 2020) got frozen, partly because of political sanctions and partly because Europe lost confidence that China would actually liberalize market access as promised. Nevertheless, Europe still engages: leaders like Germany’s Scholz have visited Beijing to maintain dialogue. They sometimes raise human rights or unfair practices more openly now (playing to domestic audiences), but the approach is to manage differences rather than exacerbate them. In sum, Europe views Xi’s policies as a sign that China may be turning inward and is certainly turning more authoritarian, which complicates but does not completely halt cooperation. Global South: Many governments in Asia, Africa, and Latin America don’t openly criticize Xi’s domestic policies – they consider those China’s internal affairs. Some even find aspects appealing: Xi’s anti-corruption campaign, for example, was watched with interest by leaders in countries plagued by corruption who wished they had the same clout to jail powerful wrongdoers (though of course in China’s case it’s also political). Likewise, the idea of common prosperity – tackling inequality – resonates positively. However, intellectuals and civil society in places like Africa or Latin America, who might have looked to China as a growth model, express disappointment at the tighter censorship and political controls under Xi. The earlier narrative (in the 2000s) of “China shows you can grow without democracy” is now tempered by “but it comes at the cost of personal freedoms and possibly entrepreneurial freedom.” Some in the Global South question if Xi’s clampdown on tech firms will stifle the very innovation that made China dynamic, and they contrast it with India’s more unruly but vibrant tech scene. Still, on balance, the Global South’s public stance remains business-first: they engage with China as it is. If anything, Xi’s stronger grip assures foreign partners that deals made with China will be seen through (political stability), albeit with the risk that if you cross political lines, fallout can be severe (as some found when they spoke on Xinjiang or met the Dalai Lama – swift Chinese retaliation followed). So, they tread carefully, often avoiding sensitive topics like Xinjiang or human rights at the official level.
	9.	Rebalancing to consumption – external advice and interests: United States & EU: Western economists have long urged China to shift from export- and investment-led growth to a more consumption-driven model. This isn’t purely altruistic: if Chinese consumers buy more imports, that’s good for Western exporters. The U.S. in particular used to complain about low Chinese consumption as part of the imbalances issue (Chinese oversaving kept its currency weak, fueling the trade surplus). Janet Yellen and the IMF frequently recommend stronger social safety nets in China, higher household income share, and letting unproductive SOEs die so capital can go to more efficient, often private, uses – all to boost productivity and consumption. Europe similarly would benefit if China imported more luxury goods, autos, and machinery instead of trying to make everything domestically. So Western policy advice aligns with what Kroeber describes: get Chinese consumers spending. In terms of strategic stance, the U.S. also sees a Chinese middle class with more economic power as potentially a liberalizing force (though that hasn’t really materialized yet). Interestingly, since COVID and the war in Ukraine, Western economies themselves are rebalancing slightly towards industrial policy and away from hyper-globalized consumption – but they still want China to open up its consumer market. When China announced in 2022-23 new measures to encourage domestic spending (like cutting car purchase taxes or promoting e-commerce in rural areas), global investors cheered, as it signals China will contribute to global demand (helping, say, German carmakers or Australian wine exporters). However, there’s skepticism abroad about how genuine and fast this rebalancing will be – it’s a structural challenge. Global South: Other developing countries stand to gain if China rebalances. Many export commodities or agricultural products that would find a bigger market if Chinese consumption rises. For example, more Chinese demand for foreign beef, coffee, or services like tourism benefits Latin America and Southeast Asia. Some developing economies fear that if China doesn’t rebalance and instead doubles down on exporting high-tech goods, it will move into niches they occupy. For instance, if China remains investment-heavy, it will keep looking for overseas construction projects (competing with local firms) and keep expanding manufacturing capacity (competing with places like Mexico or Turkey in mid-tech manufacturing). If instead China’s consumers start buying more, perhaps there’s room for everyone’s exports. Moreover, a China that becomes more consumer-import oriented could alleviate some South-South competition. Today, China often competes with other emerging economies in third markets; if China’s own market opens, those same countries could sell to China. Politically, many in the Global South gently echo the call for China to open its markets – but they do so within friendly forums. They might ask China to import more value-added goods, not just raw materials, as part of making South-South trade more balanced. China has made some nods, e.g. hosting import expos touting opportunities for foreign brands, and signing tariff-free deals with least-developed countries. But critics say these are modest steps and China’s market remains difficult to penetrate for many processed goods (due to standards, state procurement favoring local, etc.). In summary, global consensus (outside perhaps some hardliners in China) is that more domestic consumption in China would be positive – Western nations for rebalancing trade, and Global South for more export opportunities and a healthier Chinese economy that won’t export deflation. The difference is, Western commentary sometimes frames it as “China’s responsibility” as a major power to correct global imbalances, whereas China itself frames any consumption boost as purely a domestic evolution, not something done to appease foreigners.
	10.	Tech race – AI and advanced industries: United States: The U.S. is determined to maintain a lead in AI, quantum computing, biotech, and other frontier technologies – and to limit China’s access to the most critical tech. The U.S. Commerce Department’s export controls on semiconductors (implemented in 2022) are a clear manifestation: they explicitly aim to stop China from obtaining top-end chips and the equipment to make them. The rationale given is national security – preventing China from using AI for military or repression (like AI-driven surveillance). The U.S. has also lobbied allies (Netherlands, Japan) to align on restricting lithography machines and other inputs. This is essentially an attempt to slow China’s progress by a few years or more, buying time for U.S. industry to widen the gap. On AI software, there’s debate: open-source models mean China can replicate some advances. But the U.S. still has an edge in cutting-edge research (the best academic labs) and the most widely used AI platforms (American companies like Google, OpenAI, Microsoft are leaders). The Pentagon and U.S. tech firms are now collaborating more to ensure AI advances serve U.S. interests as well (e.g. Project Maven on AI for military imagery). Strategically, many in Washington think AI dominance could translate to military dominance – hence talk of an “AI arms race.” There’s also the angle of values: U.S. policymakers often argue that American AI will be used in line with democratic values, whereas Chinese AI might enable authoritarianism (facial recognition to suppress dissent, etc.). This narrative is used to rally allied countries to prefer Western tech ecosystems. European Union: Europe is somewhat caught in between. It doesn’t have tech giants on the scale of the U.S. or China in AI, though it has strength in certain areas (robotics in Germany, AI research in the UK – now outside EU – and France). The EU focus is on regulation: the forthcoming EU AI Act will set rules on AI use (like banning social scoring systems, requiring transparency for algorithms, etc.). Europeans are wary of both U.S. and Chinese tech dominance – they talk about “technological sovereignty” so they aren’t entirely dependent on foreign AI. In practice, Europe leans toward the U.S. on hard tech (e.g. ASML, a Dutch firm, complies with U.S. export curbs; European telecoms increasingly phase out Huawei). But Europe also wants to remain a neutral arbiter of tech norms, setting ethical standards that hopefully both U.S. and Chinese firms might follow if they want access to the EU market. As for China specifically, EU nations collaborate with China in some R&D but are growing cautious – e.g. China’s talent recruitment programs raised concerns of tech leakage from European labs. The EU agrees with the U.S. on restricting military-use technology to China but is less strict on purely commercial tech. If U.S.–China tech competition escalates, Europe’s concern is being forced to choose sides and potentially losing access to either Chinese tech solutions or the Chinese market for its own tech companies. Global South: Many developing countries stand to benefit from affordable AI and tech solutions, regardless of origin. Chinese firms (like Huawei in telecom, Hikvision in surveillance, or upcoming AI companies) often offer cheaper products and sometimes tailor-made for developing contexts (for example, simpler AI tools that can run on less advanced infrastructure). These countries are less concerned with who “wins” the AI race than with bridging their own digital divide. Chinese tech is attractive where cost is a big factor – witness how Huawei built much of Africa’s 4G networks when Western firms were pricier. For AI, if Chinese firms offer, say, smart city systems or FinTech that can be deployed in Nairobi or Karachi at lower cost, they will find customers. That said, there are emerging debates on digital sovereignty: some African and Asian states worry about being too reliant on Chinese digital systems (just as earlier they worried about Western dominance). For instance, if a country’s government and security apparatus relies on Chinese surveillance tech, could that be a backdoor for Chinese intelligence? Western diplomats warn of this; China denies it. Some countries (like those in Europe’s immediate neighborhood) have pushed back – e.g. in 2020, under U.S. pressure, some Balkan states reconsidered Chinese 5G deals. The Global South viewpoint often emphasizes technology transfer: they don’t want to just import Huawei or Cisco; they want their people trained and some local value-add. China sometimes does this (trainings, joint ventures), but not always to the degree locals hope. As AI and automation advance, a fear in developing countries is that reshoring happens – i.e. advanced economies, with robots and AI, produce at home, cutting out developing manufacturing exporters. In that sense, they watch the U.S.–China tech race warily, knowing that if both succeed in high automation, the old path of labor-intensive export-led growth may close. Thus, countries like India argue for their own tech development (India invests in its digital public goods and IT industry to remain relevant). Others call for international governance of AI that includes their voices, so the rules aren’t just set by Washington or Beijing. In summary, the Global South largely wants a multipolar tech world where they aren’t dependent on one superpower’s tech, and they can access innovations affordably. They will take Chinese AI or Western AI as long as it meets their needs and budget, but they also don’t want to be caught in a binary sanctions war (e.g. having to rip out Chinese equipment because of Western sanctions or vice versa). It’s a delicate balance and many will try to hedge – e.g. using Chinese hardware but Western software, or any combination that secures their interests. The outcome of the U.S.–China competition will significantly shape these nations’ development options in the coming decades.

Synthesis of Insights and Global Debate (Stage 3)

China’s extraordinary manufacturing ascent, as illuminated by Arthur Kroeber, rests on a paradox that shapes global debate: an authoritarian state achieving market-scale success. Kroeber’s first key insight is that China’s rise poses a challenge not simply because of its size, but because of how it attained wealth – through an export juggernaut and state-driven industrial strategy that many abroad view as unfair or destabilizing. He notes that China’s massive trade surpluses and industrial dominance fuel resentment in the West, where millions of manufacturing jobs were lost even as consumers enjoyed cheaper goods ￼. At the same time, China’s political model – an “incredibly successful authoritarian system” – collides with the self-image of the U.S. and its allies who championed liberal democracy as the post-Cold War development path ￼. This has created an almost visceral unease among U.S. elites who have “never…gotten comfortable” with the Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy ￼. Global perspectives diverge on this issue. American policymakers frame China’s trading practices as mercantilist predation, arguing Beijing uses subsidies and a controlled market to enrich itself at others’ expense ￼. The prevailing U.S. view is that China’s growth, under its current rules, undermines the global level playing field – hence tariffs, tech export bans, and efforts to “reset” trade terms have enjoyed bipartisan support. U.S. discourse often adds an ideological dimension: China’s success is portrayed as a threat to democratic values globally, casting the rivalry as a contest of systems.

Europeans, while sharing many U.S. economic concerns, approach China’s rise with a more pragmatic tone. The EU acknowledges problems like overcapacity and subsidized exports – European industries (from steel to solar panels) have been hurt by Chinese competition ￼ – yet it stops short of demonizing China’s development. Instead, European leaders speak of “de-risking” relations: tightening safeguards on critical sectors and reducing one-sided dependencies, but not severing broad economic ties ￼. Europe still seeks engagement – for instance, negotiating investment agreements or climate cooperation – even as it cautiously addresses grievances on market access and human rights. The underlying belief in Brussels is that a prosperous China integrated into a rules-based order is better than a volatile, isolated China. European officials also remain less publicly ideological; they criticize specific Chinese policies (e.g. forced tech transfer, Xinjiang abuses) but refrain from framing the entire relationship as an existential clash of governance models. In the Global South, reactions to China’s rise are colored by local interests and historical context. Developing nations largely appreciate the benefits China brought – affordable consumer goods, infrastructure investment, and a powerful example of rapid poverty reduction. For many poorer countries, China’s growth has been more opportunity than threat: it became a huge market for commodities and a source of financing when Western investors were hesitant. But there is an undercurrent of anxiety too. Manufacturers in countries like Mexico, Bangladesh, or South Africa know the strain of competing with China’s scale and efficiency. African textile factories, for example, often struggle because Chinese imports dominate local markets ￼. Some economists from emerging economies warn that China’s dominance in key value chains (from electronics to green tech) could stifle their own industrial dreams ￼. Nonetheless, few in the Global South blame China outright – instead they critique the structure of the global economy that allows such imbalances, and they call on China (as a fellow “developing country” in rhetoric) to support more South-South trade and technology transfer. In forums like BRICS or the Belt and Road Initiative, developing countries leverage relations with Beijing to gain projects and loans, while quietly hoping China will import more of their higher-value goods, not just raw materials. In summary, where the U.S. sees a zero-sum contest and Europe sees a challenge to mitigate, the Global South tries to position China’s rise as an engine to ride – albeit one that shouldn’t run them over.

A second major theme from Kroeber is the misleading analogy of a new Cold War. He argues forcefully that today’s Sino-American interdependence has no precedent in the old U.S.–Soviet rivalry ￼ ￼. China’s deep integration into global trade, investment, and supply chains means decoupling would carry immense costs for all sides. Moreover, he contends that unlike the USSR, China will not simply collapse or capitulate; it is “too successful” economically and any new Chinese government would likely pursue the same national goals of strength and tech progress ￼ ￼. This view pushes against triumphalist strategies and implies that the West must find a modus vivendi with a strong China rather than await its downfall. Views on this differ sharply across regions. In Washington, a hawkish narrative does cast China as the new Soviet Union, an adversary to be contained. This is evident in U.S. strategic documents that label China the “pacing challenge” and speak of an ideological battle. Yet even U.S. officials acknowledge the unprecedented economic intertwining – hence the more nuanced doctrine lately of “compete where we must, cooperate where we can.” Still, a faction of U.S. politicians seems willing to absorb economic pain for security gains, openly discussing decoupling critical supply chains (for instance, bringing semiconductor fabrication back to American soil, even if it means higher costs). The U.S. public, influenced by security and human-rights concerns, has grown more skeptical of China, making a hardline stance politically viable. Europe by contrast resists a Cold War framing. French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, has stated that Europe should not be “vassals” in a U.S.–China conflict and that framing everything as a binary choice is unwise. Ursula von der Leyen’s concept of de-risking explicitly distinguishes from decoupling, arguing for a balance between competition and continued engagement ￼. European nations, with their economies highly linked to global trade, are keenly aware that a U.S.–China rupture or bloc division would be detrimental. They advocate for reinforcing the multilateral system (WTO reform, international standards) to accommodate China’s rise, rather than isolating China. This reflects both idealism – a belief in rules over power politics – and self-interest, since Europe benefits from stable trade with both East and West. In the Global South, there is a palpable aversion to Cold War alignments. Many countries recall the era of proxy conflicts and don’t wish to be forced to choose sides between Washington and Beijing. Instead, they emphasize a multipolar world where they have agency. For example, ASEAN nations explicitly promote inclusive regional architectures to keep both U.S. and China engaged productively. India, while clashing with China on borders and banning some Chinese tech, still trades with China and works with it in BRICS – epitomizing hedging behavior. African Union leaders, when asked, often say they want good relations with all major powers and reject the notion that they must pick a camp. Kroeber’s argument that “everyone has a stake in China continuing to succeed” ￼ resonates strongly outside the West: a faltering Chinese economy could spell disaster for commodity exporters and those relying on Chinese finance. Thus, developing countries often counsel patience and dialogue, hoping U.S.–China tensions cool. They note that decoupling in high-tech sectors among giants might leave them holding obsolete technologies or facing higher costs, so they prefer an integrated global tech ecosystem. In summary, while U.S. hawks invoke a Cold War redux and decoupling moves gain momentum, Europe and the Global South mostly urge a more fluid approach that neither idealizes nor demonizes China but seeks new frameworks to avoid a ruinous split.

Kroeber’s third major insight centers on China’s state-guided industrial success – exemplified by its leap into electric vehicles – and the possibility of a “grand bargain” between China and the West over tech spheres. He suggests that rather than trying to constrain China to low-value manufacturing (a notion he calls unviable ￼), the U.S. might benefit by inviting Chinese advanced manufacturers into its own market under rules, recapitulating how China itself learned from foreign investors ￼ ￼. This provocative idea runs against the grain of current Western policy. In the U.S., the mood is firmly opposed to Chinese investment in strategic industries, due to espionage and security fears. Chinese telecom firm Huawei, for instance, is banned and even forced to rip out equipment from rural American networks; a proposed Chinese-owned corn mill near a U.S. Air Force base was nixed on security grounds. Legislation is under consideration to scrutinize or block outbound investment in China’s tech sector as well. So Kroeber’s “open up and compete” prescription finds little political traction, though some economists support it in theory (arguing that competition from Chinese firms could lower prices and spur innovation in the U.S., as Japanese carmakers once did). Europe has been more open to Chinese investment historically – Chinese companies own stakes in European ports, automakers (e.g. Geely owning Volvo Cars), and other assets. But here too attitudes are hardening; the EU now screens foreign investments for security, and deals that hand China too much sensitive capacity (like 5G networks or semiconductor plants) face pushback. Still, Europe has not shut the door entirely – Chinese battery makers are building big factories in Germany and Hungary, for example, complementing Europe’s electric car push. European officials tread a fine line, wanting to benefit from Chinese capital and know-how (especially in green tech) but wary of dependency or technology leakage that could erode Europe’s industrial base in the long run. For the Global South, Kroeber’s notion of leveraging Chinese investment is intuitive – many developing countries actively court Chinese factories and infrastructure projects. They see value in learning from Chinese companies, much as China once learned from the West. Countries like Vietnam and Indonesia have indeed gained Chinese FDI in manufacturing, and they impose local partnership or content rules to extract spillovers (much as China did). These countries generally don’t share the U.S. security concerns at the same level (with the exception of India). Instead, their concern is more about terms of investment: ensuring it creates local jobs, doesn’t just import Chinese labor, and that environmental standards are met. By and large, the Global South welcomes Chinese capital as a counterbalance to Western or domestic investors. If anything, they would endorse Kroeber’s win-win vision of open competition – though in practice, they also fear being swept aside if Chinese firms are too strong. This is why some countries negotiate hard – for instance, Brazil and others requiring that Chinese firms set up local research centers or use local inputs. In essence, whereas the U.S. sees a Trojan horse in Chinese investment, and Europe sees both opportunity and risk, developing nations mostly see an opportunity (with manageable risk) to accelerate their own development by plugging into China’s industrial ecosystem.

Another insight from Kroeber is the nature of China’s industrial policy – functioning like a high-stakes venture capitalist – and how it contrasts with past models. He argues China succeeded not by flawless central planning but through iterative experimentation backed by relentless funding and competitive pressure ￼ ￼. China’s willingness to pour hundreds of billions into emerging sectors, accepting that many efforts will fail, stands in stark contrast to the Western market-driven approach and even to Japan’s more targeted dirigisme. This has spurred reflection across the world. In Washington, there is grudging acknowledgement that certain technologies might never develop domestically without state support (hence the CHIPS subsidies), effectively learning from China’s playbook. But U.S. strategy is still constrained by politics – it’s one thing to fund a chip fab (with clear security rationale), another to broadly subsidize multiple industries “just in case” the way China does. The American economic ethos remains uncomfortable with massive government picking-winners, so U.S. industrial policy tends to be narrower. Moreover, the U.S. relies on its venture capital and private tech giants to do much of the heavy lifting in innovation; proponents argue this is a strength of the U.S. system, yielding more genuine innovation than top-down directives. European nations, which historically had more state involvement, are revisiting those roots. The EU now talks of “strategic autonomy” in supply chains and is bending its strict state-aid rules to allow for industrial subsidies in semiconductors and green tech (a response both to China and the U.S.’s IRA). Europe’s challenge is coordination – unlike a unitary state, 27 EU countries each want a piece of the investment. Still, the shift is notable: Europe is essentially saying that some government direction is needed to ensure future competitiveness, implicitly validating what China demonstrated on a grand scale. For Europe, which lost out in some tech waves (no European equivalent of Google/Amazon, for instance), China’s state-driven success in creating domestic tech champions is a case study in what might be done differently – though Europeans would point out they prefer to champion industries in line with their values (e.g. clean energy rather than surveillance tech). In the Global South, China’s approach has reignited interest in developmental states. Mid-sized countries like Malaysia or Turkey have launched or revived industrial master plans targeting industries from petrochemicals to electric vehicles, clearly inspired by East Asian models old and new. There’s a sense of “if China can do it, perhaps so can we”, using selective protection and heavy investment. However, capacity and governance constraints limit success – few can match China’s bureaucratic competence or financial firepower. Some countries, after failed experiences, remain skeptical: Latin America in the 20th century tried protectionist industrialization and ended up with debt and inefficient industries, a trauma that still influences policy there. Thus, while China’s venture-style heavy investment is admired, many in the Global South are cautious not to overshoot. They are also mindful that China’s presence complicates their efforts – for instance, a country might aim to develop a solar panel industry, but competing with China’s established giants (and subsidies) is daunting. This leads to calls for global rules on subsidies and fair competition – paradoxically aligning developing countries sometimes with Western complaints. In trade talks, emerging economies have begun voicing that China is no longer just a fellow developing country but a dominant player whose policies can hurt other developing markets. This nuanced position shows that China’s industrial policy, while a model, is also a moving target others must respond to with both emulation and defensive measures.

Kroeber also delves into China’s financial management and debt, highlighting how Beijing avoided systemic crises by learning from Japan’s bubble and keeping its financial system insulated. Globally, there’s an interesting split in perception here. Western officials often remain worried that China’s opaque finances hide risks – a sudden property sector collapse or local government default could, in a worst case, trigger global contagion (through confidence channels if not direct exposure). Hence, Western-led institutions like the IMF press China to address debt more transparently. In 2023, ratings agencies and banks closely watched the default of China’s giant property developer Evergrande and others, fearing it might presage a broader credit crunch. Beijing’s approach of slow, controlled deflation of these bubbles reassured some observers but drew criticism from others for being too slow to reform (keeping zombie firms alive). Western economists generally agree with Kroeber that China’s debt likely means a prolonged slowdown rather than a Lehman-style crash ￼. In strategic terms, a slower-growing China is seen in Washington as easier to handle – some even view it as validation that the U.S. system is superior in the long run. But on the financial front, the West’s main demand is that China participate responsibly in global debt relief efforts for third countries. The clash over Zambia and Sri Lanka’s debt restructuring, where China was seen as dragging its feet, has become a point of contention. The U.S. and EU side with multilateral lenders in urging China to take haircuts on loans; China insists others (like the World Bank) should also write off debt, which they thus far refuse. This debt diplomacy issue puts China somewhat at odds with Western and even some developing-nation creditors. For the Global South, China’s stable handling of its domestic debt is mostly a relief – a hard crash in China would spell disaster for commodity prices and investment flows to emerging markets. Many developing countries are indirectly “decoupling” from overreliance on Western lending by turning to China, so they watch how China handles defaults with great interest. Some have been frustrated – borrowers facing Chinese creditors sometimes find negotiations tough, since China lacks the unified framework of the Paris Club. Others appreciate that China has extended grace periods and re-financed loans in bilateral talks quietly. For China’s part, its official line is that it is a developing country itself, doing its best to help others, but it won’t forgive debt easily because it has domestic poor to think of. This resonates with some Global South leaders, who don’t expect China to just write off debt (after all, Western lenders rarely do except in extreme cases). Still, as more countries face debt distress, China’s role as the largest bilateral creditor in the world is under scrutiny. In sum, Kroeber’s point that China segmented financial risk and can handle its debt internally is accepted by experts, but externally China is under pressure to apply a similar pragmatism to the debt it holds abroad. This intersection of domestic policy and international expectation is a new challenge – China is learning that being a global creditor comes with demands for leadership, transparency, and coordination that it historically avoided.

Moving to economic efficiency versus effectiveness, Kroeber’s argument that China prioritized effectiveness (growth, poverty alleviation) over textbook efficiency resonates differently across audiences. In the West, especially among economists, there’s a growing acknowledgment that some inefficiencies (industrial redundancies, high savings, etc.) were integral to China’s growth miracle. Researchers note that while China misallocated capital by market standards, it achieved rapid urbanization and infrastructure build-out that laid the foundation for productivity gains. However, Western economics still stresses that as China transitions to a mature economy, it must improve efficiency to avoid stagnation – essentially a timeline argument (inefficiency may be tolerable in catch-up growth, but not forever). This ties to reforms Western advisors have long pushed: let uncompetitive state firms fail, improve capital allocation, encourage more private sector competition in sectors dominated by oligopolies, etc. To Western businesses, inefficiencies in China (like excess capacity or bureaucratic delays) are viewed as costs of doing business there, though often outweighed by market size and speed of execution. Western policymakers sometimes leverage China’s perceived inefficiencies to justify certain policies: for instance, one could argue China’s massive subsidies create global oversupply (inefficient globally), hence tariffs or anti-dumping duties are needed to correct that. In Europe, notions of social and regional cohesion strike a chord with Kroeber’s point about spreading growth beyond what a purely profit-driven system might do ￼. The EU’s own structural funds for poorer member regions echo this philosophy. Europeans can thus appreciate that China’s “inefficient” investments often went into developing interior provinces or maintaining employment – things Europeans value under the label of social stability. Meanwhile, in developing nations, there is often less emphasis on efficiency in academic discourse and more on tangible results. Many leaders in Africa or South Asia, grappling with huge infrastructure deficits, would readily accept some waste if it means building much-needed roads, power grids, and housing quickly. For them, China’s willingness to bulldoze through cost-benefit analyses and just build is admirable – they point out that Western-funded projects often take years of studies and conditionalities and still never materialize. Thus, Kroeber’s notion that “inefficiency can be a byproduct of success” ￼ might be taken almost as validation of their impatience with Western aid bureaucracy. However, these countries also face budget constraints China managed to overcome; if they try to emulate China’s heavy investment with less discipline or financial muscle, it could backfire into inflation or unsustainable debt (many have learned this the hard way). So the lesson they often draw is: inefficiency might be acceptable if you have a controlled system and sufficient savings, which China had. Without those, it’s risky.

Finally, in discussing technology and the future, Kroeber highlights that China’s leadership is doubling down on techno-nationalism, assuming that breakthroughs in areas like AI, semiconductors, and green tech will secure economic prosperity and global influence. He warns that this approach – focusing narrowly on high-tech output without fostering broad-based demand – can lead to imbalances (like cutting-edge factories but underemployed youth, or deflation from overcapacity) ￼ ￼. The global debate on China’s tech rise is intense. In the U.S., China’s advances in 5G, quantum computing, space, and AI have flipped the narrative from seeing China as a copier to a formidable innovator. This realization spurred the current tech restrictions: the U.S. hopes to hamper China’s most advanced sectors enough to preserve a lead. There’s also a moral component the U.S. presses – for instance, condemning China’s use of AI for surveillance of Uyghur Muslims – to argue that some technologies should not be freely traded with an authoritarian state for fear of abetting repression. The U.S. tech community, for its part, is somewhat split: many AI researchers are wary of decoupling because collaboration and open exchange of ideas fuel innovation (and Chinese researchers have been integral in global science). Others, especially in defense-related fields, support stricter controls. The U.S. public mainly encounters this issue through headlines about TikTok (a Chinese-owned app) and concerns over data privacy or propaganda. There’s a strong push in Congress to ban or force the sale of TikTok, reflecting fear that Chinese tech platforms could influence society or siphon personal data to Beijing. Europe’s stance on Chinese tech is similar in concern but softer in action. European regulators banned Huawei from 5G core networks in many countries, aligning with U.S. warnings, albeit after initial hesitance. EU states are keen to not entirely shut doors – they still allow some Chinese participation under scrutiny, and European firms eagerly sell semiconductor-making tools and luxury electric car parts to China as long as they are permitted. Europe’s approach to AI vis-à-vis China is not fully defined, but likely Europe will try to set standards (for example, if China develops powerful AI, any deployment in Europe would have to meet EU transparency and safety norms). European tech companies like Nokia or Ericsson benefited from Huawei’s exclusion, and they quietly support protective measures. Meanwhile, Europe’s automotive industry is bracing for a wave of Chinese EVs entering its market – which it could view either as a threat (hence the anti-subsidy probe launched in 2023) or as a needed competitive shock to accelerate its own transition. The Global South often welcomes Chinese tech for bridging digital gaps – Huawei built networks in places Western firms ignored; Chinese e-commerce and fintech platforms invest in Southeast Asia and Africa (e.g. Alibaba’s payments or Transsion’s smartphones dominating African markets) providing services suited to local needs. But there’s also caution: some African governments worry about dependency on a single provider and about sovereignty of their data. India provides a counter-model – it banned dozens of Chinese apps including TikTok, and is building its own digital public infrastructure to avoid Chinese dominance. Many developing countries lack India’s capacity, so they accept Chinese tech but try to keep options open (they may use some U.S. cloud services, some Chinese hardware, and explore domestic startups). As for advanced tech like AI, countries like UAE and Saudi Arabia are avidly buying into both U.S. and Chinese AI systems – whomever will help them achieve their modernization plans. These Gulf states, for example, have used Chinese facial recognition for security while also partnering with Western AI firms for other applications. In broader multilateral terms, developing countries lean towards a stance that technology should not be overly politicized: they often vote with China in the ITU or other bodies for more open tech sharing and against restrictive regimes, because they fear being left behind if tech is monopolized by a few.

In summary, Arthur Kroeber’s analysis of China’s manufacturing dominance and strategic approach reveals a landscape of admiration, anxiety, and strategic recalibration around the world. The United States, grappling with a peer competitor for the first time since the Cold War, has moved from engagement to strategic rivalry – countering China’s trade practices as “unfair” ￼, restricting its tech ascendancy, and reorienting its own economic policies to compete. The emphasis is on protecting U.S. security and economic leadership, even at the cost of some efficiency or higher costs (a notable shift in U.S. policymaking philosophy brought on by China’s rise). Europe, finding its values aligned with America but its economic interests intertwined with China, walks a tightrope: pushing back where it must (for instance, screening Chinese investments, calling out human rights issues) but also advocating dialogue and balanced interdependence rather than rupture ￼. European debates increasingly acknowledge the need to strengthen Europe’s industrial base – a page arguably taken from observing China – while maintaining that global problems (climate, health, finance) require working with Beijing, not isolating it. For the Global South, China’s trajectory offers both a model and a challenge. Many developing nations see China as a partner in their own quest for development, appreciating its investments and the notion that there isn’t only one (Western) path to prosperity. They leverage China’s presence to negotiate better terms from all sides and diversify their options. Yet, beneath the diplomatic solidarity, there is recognition that China’s overwhelming competitiveness can thwart local industry and that a world of U.S.–China polarization does them no favors. Thus, they champion a more inclusive order – one in which rising powers like China are accommodated but also expected to be responsible stakeholders that allow space for others’ growth ￼ ￼.

In the end, Kroeber’s core message is that China’s rise, driven by unique blends of state and market, is re-shaping global economics and geostrategy. Each constituency – Washington, Brussels, New Delhi, Abuja, Brasília and beyond – filters China’s experience through its own lens. Whether viewing China as rival, partner, or some fluid mix of the two, all agree on one point: China cannot be ignored. Its manufacturing dominance and state-guided ambitions demand a response, be it competitive or cooperative. The world is thus engaged in a far-reaching debate (and policy experiment) over how to integrate a powerful, non-Western, non-democratic economic titan into a global system originally designed by and for Western market democracies. The outcome of this unfolding accommodation – the “agreed set of rules” Kroeber calls for but notes is currently absent ￼ – will define international relations and prosperity in the 21st century. Each stakeholder’s perspective, from America’s security-driven caution to Africa’s development-driven pragmatism, is contributing to the new contours of globalization in the age of China.
